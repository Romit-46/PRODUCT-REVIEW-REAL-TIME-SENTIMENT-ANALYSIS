# PRODUCT-REVIEW-REAL-TIME-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS
The project focuses on real-time sentiment analysis of product reviews across platforms, using ML to transform subjective feedback into objective data for categorization by sentiment.
This project harnesses machine learning (ML) techniques for real-time sentiment analysis, targeting product reviews from various online platforms. By analyzing the text of reviews, the system employs a range of algorithms to interpret and classify the emotions and opinions expressed by consumers. The goal is to automatically sort these reviews into predefined sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral.

The innovation lies in its ability to process and analyze reviews as they are posted, offering immediate insights into customer sentiment. This real-time capability enables businesses to quickly respond to customer feedback, address concerns, and enhance product offerings. Utilizing diverse ML algorithms, the project translates the subjective nature of reviews into objective, quantitative data. This not only aids in monitoring overall customer satisfaction but also provides valuable analytics for improving product quality and customer service strategies.
